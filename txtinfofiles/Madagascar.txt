Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, <br>
approximately 400 kilometres (250 miles) off the coast of East Africa across the Mozambique Channel. <br>
At 592,800 square kilometres (228,900 sq mi) Madagascar is the world's second-largest island country, after Indonesia.<br>
 The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world) and numerous smaller peripheral islands.<br>
  Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian subcontinent around 88 million years ago,<br>
   allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation.<br>
    Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. <br>
    The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.<br>
