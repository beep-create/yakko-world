Fiji, officially the Republic of Fiji, is an island country in Melanesia, part of Oceania in the South Pacific Ocean. <br>
It lies about 1,100 nautical miles (2,000 km; 1,300 mi) northeast of New Zealand. <br>
Fiji consists of an archipelago of more than 330 islands—of which about 110 are permanently inhabited—and more than 500 islets, <br>
amounting to a total land area of about 18,300 square kilometres (7,100 sq mi). <br>
The most outlying island group is Ono-i-Lau. About 87% of the total population of 883,483 live on the two major islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. <br>
About three-quarters of Fijians live on Viti Levu's coasts: either in the capital city of Suva; <br>
or in smaller urban centres such as Nadi—where tourism is the major local industry; or in Lautoka, where the sugar-cane industry is dominant. <br>
The interior of Viti Levu is sparsely inhabited because of its terrain.<br>
