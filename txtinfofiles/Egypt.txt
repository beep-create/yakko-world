Egypt, officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa <br>
and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. <br>
Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip (Palestine) and Israel to the northeast, <br>
the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the east, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. <br>
Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, across the Red Sea lies Saudi Arabia, <br>
and across the Mediterranean lie Greece, Turkey and Cyprus, although none share a land border with Egypt.<br>
