Guinea-Bissau, officially the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, is a country in West Africa that covers 36,125 square kilometres <br>
 with an estimated population of 1,874,303.<br>
It borders Senegal to the north and Guinea to the south-east. <br>
Guinea-Bissau was once part of the kingdom of Kaabu, as well as part of the Mali Empire.<br>
 Parts of this kingdom persisted until the 18th century, while a few others were under some rule by the Portuguese Empire since the 16th century. 
 In the 19th century, it was colonised as Portuguese Guinea.<br>
Upon independence, declared in 1973 and recognised in 1974, the name of its capital, Bissau, was added to the country's name to prevent confusion with Guinea.<br>
Guinea-Bissau has a history of political instability since independence, and only one elected president (José Mário Vaz) has successfully served a full five-year term. <br>
The current president is Umaro Sissoco Embaló, who was elected on 29 December 2019.<br>
